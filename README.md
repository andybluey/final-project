# final-project
This is the final project for GA - WDi 16, an individual. I wanted to use React - something briefly touched on in class, as well as the Github API to see what could be created with d3js. This was a challenging project to complete in a week, but it helped me to get a much better understand of React and learn d3.

## How to view app

## Technology Used:
- React
